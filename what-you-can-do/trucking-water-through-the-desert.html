        <h1>Trucking water trough the desert</h1>

        <p>Our emergency relief programm involves extracing drinking water from seawater through large desalination plants at the coast and transporting it to the cities and remote villages by truck. The project is still in it's initial phase but it has already achieved very promising results.

In 2020, we were able to provide over 900,000 liters of fresh drinking water from a single seawater destilation plant which has been under construction since 2019 and which will be fully operational by the summer of 2021. The fresh water was transported to a hand full of remote villages by two Load King 4,000 gallon water trucks which operated about weekly over the course of half a year during the extremly hot summer season. The operation saved all of the approximetly 3,000 villagers.

        <p>
          Sadly with our projects we're only scratching the surface. At any given point during the hot summers there are hundrets of small isolated villages with a estimated population of over one million, who are suffering from water scarcity.

        To be able to provide the huge amounts of water required we need to at least quadruple the number of destilation plant and also massively icrease our fleet of water trucks. The water trucks alone will cost upwards of 1.2 million dollars, the destilationplants will each cost about half a million to construct bringing the total cost to 3.2 million dollars. About two thirds of which will be provided by the American government and other non-profits. The leaves only about a million to be donated, half of which has already been donated. To close the remaining gap we kindly ask you for a small donation, since every penny brings us close to our final goal â€“ an end to the water crisis in Somaliland.</p>
