        <h1>Rural flight</h1>
        <p>Because of the lack of water and the resulting spare vegetation, rural areas are faced with the problem of dying livestock and since most of the soil doesn't allow for any farming, hunger and starvation are the consequences. Trying to escape those conditions, many villagers and farmers abandon their homes and migrate to the cities. Hawo Mohamed is one of those migrants. Her story illustrates the terrible situation and shows the despair of the locals.

The image above shows the village of Bulo Har. Once a beautiful little village, it has now become a mostly abandonned barren wasteland where the remaining villagers are fighting to survive.

It was one morning, she tells us, that she found about a dozen of her goats dead. She was a pastoralist at the time, raised in the village of Bulo Har, a remote village in coastal Somaliland, where she was still living at the time. From her childhood, she remembers taking her family's goats to feed on green pastures flanked by small groups of trees. But those times are long gone. About eight years ago, the trees started dying and grass grew much more erratic, growing even less and less in the following years. Over time her animals, starved of food and water, grew weaker too. "One day I went to collect the animals as usual and brought them home, but the next morning 10 to 12 of them were dead," Mohamed recalls.

  When only a few of our animals were left, I saw my neighbors had already started to move, and we went with them ... I knew nothing would be the same again.

Only a few months later, Mohamed, her husband and their four children joined the estimated 600,000 people in Somaliland who fled from rural to urban areas that year. They in particular fled to Berbera a city with less than 80,000 inhabitants. However, the cities in the area are oftentimes overwhelmed by the sheer amount of rural refugees, which leads to unemployment and homelessness. Today Mohamed and her family are living in a corrugated iron shack raising their four children, one of which is still an infant. She and her husband are both unemployed and only work small, low-paid jobs from time to time, which gives them barely enough to survive.

The fate of Mohamed and her family is not an individual case by any means. Since 1960 the rural population has halved in Somaliland. The cities are overpopulated and illness and hunger spread rapidly.

<p>The government of Somaliland is aware of the problem, but they currently don't have the resources to effectively counteract it nor to relief the situation in the cities. This means that every day until a solution is found many people all across the region are migrating to the cities desperately hoping for a better live, only to find themselves in a situation hardly any better than before.</p>
