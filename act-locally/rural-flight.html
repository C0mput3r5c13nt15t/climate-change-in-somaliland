    <h1>Rural flight</h1>
    <p>
      Because of the lack of water and the resulting spare vegetation, rural areas are faced with the problem of dying livestock and since the soil most of doesn't allow for any farming, hunger and starvation are the consequences. Trying to escape those conditions many villagers and farmers abandon their homes and migrate to the cities. Hawo Mohamed is one of those migrants. Her story illustrates the terrible situation and shows the despair of the locals.

      It was one morning she tells us that she found about a dozen of her goats dead. She was a pastoralist at the time, raised in the village of Bulo Har, a remote village in coastal Somaliland, where she was still living at the time. From her childhood she remembers taking her family's goats to feed on green pastures flanked by small groups of trees. But those times are long gone. About eight years ago the trees started dying and gras grew much more erratic, growing less and less over the years. Over time her animals, starved of food and water, grew weaker too. "One day I went to collect the animals as usual and brought them home but the next morning 10 to 12 of them were dead," Mohamed recalls.

      "When only a few of our animals were left, I saw my neighbors had already started to move and I went with them ... I knew nothing would be the same again."

      That day Mohamed, her husband and four children joined the estimated 600,000 people in Somaliland who fled from rural to urban areas that year. They in particular fled to Berbera a city with less than 80,000 inhabitants. However the cities in these area are oftentimes overwhelmed by the sheer amount of rural refugees, which leads to unemployment and homelessness. Today Mohamed and her family are living a corrugated iron shack raising their four children, one of which is still an infant. She and her husband are both unemployed only work small low-paid jobs from time to time, which gives them barely enough to survive.

      The fate of Mohamed and her family is not an individual case however. Since 1960 the rural population has halved in Somaliland. The cities are overpopulated and illness and hunger spread rapidly.
