        <h1>Living conditions</h1>

        <p>
          In Somaliland, more than 73% of the population live in poverty, 43% even live in extreme poverty. Unemployment has also always been high, with about 10% of the population unemployed, but since climate change has disrupted the agricultural sector, livestock farming in particular, this number has skyrocketed to over 20%. This together with water and food shortage is responsible for the terrible living conditions in the region and a life expectancy of under 50 years.

          Even though the living conditions in the whole region are bad, the living conditions of those in rural areas are even worse. The rural population consists of a few nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes, but mostly small villages and farms and lives from agriculture, which makes them vulnerable towards climate changes. Because of the little rain and the many droughts, it's estimated that about 1 million people are facing extreme hunger. However, helping them is made very difficult by the missing infrastructure, like streets or rails. If nothing is done, thousands of people might starve to death because of that.

        <p>
          At first glance life in the cities of the region, like Berbera or Hargeysa looks a lot better, there are roads, small apartment buildings and the streets are roamed cars, market stands and people buying and selling all kinds of goods. And indeed it is somewhat better, however it's also a very fragile situation. The water shortages for example have to be balanced with water transports. During the summer up to 80% of the water supply have to be trucked it, so that if anything happened like some trucks malfunctioning or if there was no water to import the consequences would be disastrous. Further, the increase in rural refugees has overpopulated the cities and has left many people homeless and without a job.
