                  <h2>Somaliland</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Republic of Somaliland is a de facto sovereign state which is considered by most countries to be part of Somalia. It lies in eastern Africa on the Gulf of Aden and has a population of 5.7 million on 177,000 km². With a total GDP of under 5 billion USD and a GDP per capita of 310 USD in 2020, the country and its inhabitants are very poor. In fact, it is one of the poorest regions in the world.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    In recent years Somaliland has faced many crises, but the most urgent one is global warming which has led to droughts, poor living conditions and rural flight. Here you can find information about the global issue of climate change, its local consequences in Somaliland and the way in which we can help Somaliland overcome its most difficult challenge.

                  <h2>Living conditions</h2>
                  <p>
                    In Somaliland, more than 73% of the population live in poverty, 43% even live in extreme poverty. Unemployment has also always been high, with about 10% of the population unemployed, but since climate change has disrupted the agricultural sector, livestock farming in particular, this number has skyrocketed to over 20%. This together with water and food shortage is responsible for the terrible living conditions in the region and a life expectancy of under 50 years.

                  <h2>Rural flight</h2>
                  <p>
                    Because of the lack of water and the resulting spare vegetation, rural areas are faced with the problem of dying livestock and since most of the soil doesn't allow for any farming, hunger and starvation are the consequences. Trying to escape those conditions, many villagers and farmers abandon their homes and migrate to the cities. Hawo Mohamed is one of those migrants. Her story illustrates the terrible situation and shows the despair of the locals.

                  <h2>Droughts</h2>
                  <p>Arid weather is a daily reality for the people of Somaliland, but the local differences are enormous. While in the south-west of the region the annual rainfall is comparable to the rainfall in cities like Berlin or Kiel, the rainfall in the east is almost none existent. On top of that, droughts are further worsening the situations in the entire region and are responsible for most of the many problems in the region. </p>

                  <h2>Causes for global warming</h2>
                  <p>
                    Climate change is one of the biggest issues, humanity has ever faced. For the last hundred years, our earth has been warming in an alarming rate. The warming proceeds due to the by now well-known greenhouse effect. CO2 gas is being emitted by many parts of the industry as well as transport and power production.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    While today almost everyone knows that factories, most cars and even cows are harmful to the climate, the numbers given by politicians, lobbyists and activists are in dimensions that are hard to imagine. This is the reason why on this page, we as a non-governmental organization want to provide you with a brief and factual overview on the causes of the human-made global warming.

                  <h2>Let's fight climate change together</h2>
                  <p>
                    Even though climate change might be a complex global problem, the steps to fight it are small ones that start with you. Start thinking about your consumption and how to reduce it. Ask yourself questions like: “Do I really need to eat meat seven times a week?” or “Can I take the bike instead of the car?”. Those steps won’t immediately make a large impact, but over time if more and more people try to live more sustainable, it will make a big difference.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Still though, this won’t be enough to solve climate change once and for all. Instead, we will need to change the system as a whole and the best way to do this is to get politically active and there are lots of ways to do so: Vote for candidates and parties that care about the environment and that actually make an effort to have a positive impact, attend demonstrations or even just talk about climate change and raise awareness in your circle of acquaintances.

                    Our emergency relief program involves extracting drinking water from seawater through large desalination plants at the coast and transporting it to the cities and remote villages by truck. The project is still in its initial phase, but it has already achieved very promising results.
