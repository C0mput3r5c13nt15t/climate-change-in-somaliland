        <p>
          Although global warming has been known since the 1960s, it is still an enormous problem. Millions of people have died from its consequences, and millions more will follow. But what is global warming, and what exactly are its consequences?

          Global warming, or more accurately man-made global warming, is the increase in the earth's temperature due to human activities. It ranges from one degree Celsius in the oceans and continents near the equator to four degrees in the Arctic. Four degrees don’t sound like much at first, but the last ice age known as the Last Glacial Maximum from roughly, 23,000 BC to 19,000 BC was roughly seven degrees colder than 2019.

          The damaging effects are countless and reach from floods and wildfires to droughts and the melting of the polar ice caps. Floods are a huge concern for cities that are near the ocean, like New York or countless villages. And even whole countries like the Netherlands might one day be fully submerged. Hurricanes, Tsunamis and other extreme weather phenomena are also occurring much more frequently due to higher temperatures. This leads to the destruction of many islands and makes travel much more dangerous. The chances of something similar to Fukushima happening again rise, too. Further, many pathogens from ancient times are trapped in the ice - if it melts, there will be a variety of new diseases, which might kill hundreds of thousands of people. Lastly, as temperature rise, lots of species are beginning to die out, so humanity could be the cause of yet another major species extinction.

          However, every single one of us will be attested. It’s true that countries like Somaliland will feel the consequences first, but eventually humanity will perish if we don’t do something about it. So global warming is in a sense the most global problem there is and according to current predictions the point of no return - a global increase in temperature of 1.5 degrees - will be reached by 2030.
