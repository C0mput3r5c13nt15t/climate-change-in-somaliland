        <h1>Causes for global warming</h1>

        <p>Climate change is one of the biggest issues, humanity has ever faced. For the last hundred years, our earth has been warming at an alarming rate. The warming proceeds due to the by now well-known greenhouse effect. CO2 gas is being emitted by many parts of the industry as well as transport and power production.

          While today almost everyone knows that factories, most cars and even cows are harmful to the climate, the numbers given by politicians, lobbyists and activists are in dimensions that are hard to imagine. This is the reason why on this page, we as a non-governmental organization want to provide you with a brief and factual overview on the causes of the human-made global warming.

        </p>

        <h3>Power generation</h3>

        <p>To generate electricity needed for our day-to-day life, massive amounts of CO2 are blasted into the air. While renewable sources are taking over in many highly developed countries, developing countries still do not have the capabilities to transition to green energy.
        </p>

        <h3>Industry</h3>

        <p>The process of manufacturing goods has an alarming impact on our climate. The production of materials like steel, iron, plastics, and especially cement is in fact one of the major sources of CO2 emissions. Further industrial resource extraction processes like drilling, mining also contribute to the global CO2 emissions. The obvious problem with those emissions is that we can’t as easily reduce them without risking the economy.

        <h3>Deforestation</h3>

        <p>Due to an increasing demand for farmland, grazing and mining as well as the need for wood as a versatile raw material, large areas of forest are being cleared every day. This irresponsible and unsustainable forestry which is especially problematic in the rainforests has already had a huge negative impact on the climate.

          Cutting down forests is bad for two main reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Firstly, trees have negative CO2 emissions. The fewer trees there are, the less CO2 is being converted into Oxygen and biomass.</p></li>
          <li><p>Secondly, felling trees releases the large amounts of stored carbon - oftentimes directly back into the atmosphere.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>

        <p>Petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles dominate the streets. They emit billions of tons of CO2 every hour. Today, there are more than 1.4 billion cars in the world, only 6 million of which are electric. However, we can see a transition to alternative means of transport, that have fever or even no emissions at all.

        </p>

        <h3>Agriculture</h3>

        <p>Whether cattle, harvesting machines or fishing boats – they all emit gross amounts of greenhouse gases. The graph below shows how those emissions divide into direct and indirect emissions and that the direct ones strongly prevail.

        <h3>Excessive consumption</h3>

        <p>Wasting goods used to be an essential element of the economy of rich countries. Companies wanted to sell as many of their products as possible while maximizing the profit margin. Especially during the time of the third industrial revolution in western countries, consumers were spending their money, not aware of the long-term problems it would cause.

          Fortunately, since the 1990s, a trend towards climate friendly consumption can be observed. This is due to increased concerns of customers about climate change, which puts the whole economy under pressure to move forward – away from ignorant behavior regarding climate change and towards a sustainable and eco-friendly economy.

        <p>
          Today, most companies are trying to reduce emissions and are willing to invest billions to do so.

        <p>
          So to sum up, it’s safe to say that there are still lost of factors contributing to climate change. However, the mindset that was once the core problem is now slowly changing, fueling innovative technologies and the will to live more sustainably and in line with the environment.
