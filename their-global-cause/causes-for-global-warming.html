        <h1>Causes for global warming</h1>

        <p>Climate change is one of the largest issues, humanity has ever faced. For the last hundred years, our earth has been warming in an alarming rate. The warming proceeds due to the by now well-known greenhouse effect. CO2 gas is being emitted by many parts of the industry as well as transport and power production. While today almost everyone knows that factories, most cars and even cows are harmful to the climate, numbers are thrown around by politicians, lobbyists and activists that are in dimensions that they become hard to imagine. This is the reason why on this page, we as a non-governmental organization want to provide you with a brief and factual overview on the causes of the human-made global warming. We do not plan on solving climate change, so we are not making up numbers. Our mission is to provide people in Somaliland with water.

        <h3>Power generation</h3>

        <p>To generate electricity needed for our day-to-day life, massive amounts of CO2 are blasted into the air. While renewable sources are taking over in many highly developed countries, especially weaker ones still do not have the capabilities to perform an energy transition. This graphics visualizes the growing ratio of renewable energy sources.

        <h3>Industry</h3>

        <p>The process of manufacturing goods and building has an alarming impact on our climate. Producing materials like steel, iron, plastics, and especially cement in fact is one of the major sources of climate hazardous emissions. Industrial resource extraction processes like drilling, mining etc. also let gases escape.

        </p>

        <h3>Deforestation</h3>

        <p>Due to an increasing demand of space for farming, grazing and mining as well as the need of wood as a versatile raw material, wide areas of forest are being cleared. An irresponsible and unsustainable forestry in some parts of the world has proceeded for many years, in which drastic damages were caused.

          Cutting down forests is bad for two reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Firstly, trees have negative CO2 emissions. The fewer trees there are, the less CO2 is being converted into Oxygen and biomass.</p></li>
          <li><p>Secondly, felling trees releases the large amounts of stored carbon and moves them into another cycle.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Transportation</h3>

        <p>Petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles dominate the streets. They blow billions of tons of CO2 out in the atmosphere. Today, there are more than 1.4 billion cars in the world, of which less than 6 million are electric. We have a long way to go. However, we can see a hope-giving transition to alternative engines going on, that have less or even no emissions at all.

        </p>

        <h3>Agriculture</h3>

        <p>Whether cattle, harvesting machines or fishing boats – they all emit gross amounts of greenhouse gases.

        </p>

        <h3>Excessive consumption</h3>

        <p>Wasting goods used to be an essential element of the economy of rich countries. Companies wanted to sell as many of their products as possible while maximizing the profit margin. Especially in the time of the third industrial revolution in western countries, consumers were glad to be able to spend their money while not being aware of climate change.

          Positively, since the 19xxs, a trend to climate friendly consuming can be recognized. This is due to increased concerns of customers about climate change. It set the whole economy under pressure to move forward – away from ignorant behavior regarding climate change.

        <p>
          Today, most companies are thinking heavily about reducing emissions – or at least try to seem to do so. In any case, we see that bold investments are being made in innovations for a better future.
