        <h1>Droughts</h1>

        <p>Arid weather is a daily reality for the people of Somaliland, but the local differences are enormous. While in the south-west of the region the annual rainfall is comparable to the rainfall in cities like Berlin or Kiel, the rainfall in the east is almost none existent. On top of that, droughts are further worsening the situations in the entire region and are responsible for most of the many problems.</p>

          The map above shows the unequal distribution of rain across the region of Somaliland.

          Somaliland is currently facing the second drought in three years - the rainy season this year only produced two rainy days in its four moth period – it's a disaster for nature, the people, the economy and the region as a whole. Livestock farming, for example, which has suffered heavily due to the drought, usually accounts for over 70% of the region's economic activity.

          Awil a shepherd and goatherd from Togdher – a region in Somaliland - was desperately trying to find water and food for his animals, but in his home region the extreme heat and drought had already dried out most of the land and plants. In his despair, Awil borrowed $400 to transport his flock the more than 300 miles here to the Gabiley district, about 37 miles from the Somaliland. He eventually arrived in October 2016 with his two sons, 11-year-old Thalil and eight-year-old Rooble. His wife and four other children stayed behind. This area, normally one of the most fertile regions of the country, has been struck hard by the drought. Now all the grazing is gone. By November, weakened by hunger and stress, the animals started to die.

          I came here with 150 animals. Now I have 30.

        <p>
          Deep in debt and with his herd dying all around him, Awil and his sons are helpless, dependent on the generosity of the locals for food. Stranded far away from his family, Awil is worried about his family's survival.

          However, Awil is only one of the many facing an existential crisis at the moment. All across the region, the drought is responsible for hunger and thirst and even suicide. Hani a 47-year-old mother for example let her husband go with over 450 animals. When he returned with only 60 of them, he hanged himself, leaving his wife and seven children behind.
